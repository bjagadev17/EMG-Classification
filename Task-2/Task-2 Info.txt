Step 1: Train the following classifiers (Fine tune each one individually and find out the best model for each classifier)
• Logistic-Regression (LR)
• KNN
• SVM
• Decision Tree
• Random Forrest
• Extra Trees
Step 2: Combine the aforementioned classifiers using different Ensemble methods (explore them in the following sequential order one by one):
• Voting
• Bagging
• Boosting
• Stacking
